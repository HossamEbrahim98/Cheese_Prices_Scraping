# Cheese_Prices_Scraping
In this task.. the manager asked me to scrap data of the prices of competitive products in the dairy field for different types of cheeses. 
In this project, part of the task that I did is related to triangle cheese and its different prices, in which I scraped data from different sites in two ways due to the presence of a ban on some sites.
### Part I (First Way [BeautifulSoup])
First, I scraped data from three different sites: Kanbkam, Metro Market, and Gomla Market, using BeautifulSoup, and merged them into one CSV file, which is located inside the project under the name Prices, and the code for scraping data is called “Scraping Prices”.
### Part II (Second Way [Selenium])
The other part of the project is that I used Selenium to access the sites and take pictures of the products and their prices from two different sites, namely Amazon and Carrefour, which is located in the code file called “Prices ScreenShots”.
